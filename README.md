Me and my coding buddy Tihomir are making Real Estate Application. The idea behind this application
is to make application where users and brokers can meet. We want to train our coding skills. Here we
are writing the back end of the application, using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

You can start the project on local with few easy steps:

-   you have to clone the repository
-   you have to write on the terminal "npm install" (you need to have Node installed on your system)
-   create .env file
-   add AZURE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING variable to the .env file and assign connection string to
    your local database or whatever you want
-   start the back end "npm run dev"

You can find the front-end repository on https://github.com/DamyanBG/real-estate-react-app
